## Docker Container

You can run the widget demo also in a Docker container.

Running an X application inside a Docker container is not trivial,
use the `run.sh` script to build the Docker image and start the container.

When you do not need the Docker image anymore run the `docker rmi widget-demo`
command to delete the image and free quite some space.
